Who doesn’t feel this way? When you get into a new topic, you are quickly overwhelmed by the amount and complexity of information. In this basics section you are exactly right to get started with the production of accessible documents.

But not only absolute beginners will be helped here. The basics also cover technical topics and help advanced users as a reference guide.

At the moment, [accessible-pdf.info](/) covers two applications for creating PDF documents, namely Adobe InDesign and Microsoft Word. Therefore, the basics are divided into the following subsections:

## General tutorials

Posts that cannot be assigned to a specific application are listed here.

- [Structure with the help of multi-level headings](/en/basics/general/structure-with-the-help-of-multi-level-headings)
- [Check semantics and logical reading order](/en/basics/general/check-semantics-and-logical-reading-order)
- [Overview of the PDF tags](/en/basics/general/overview-of-the-pdf-tags)

<p class="note">
  <strong>Reading recommendation:</strong> For a very first start, the first, short article is
  highly recommended. Since the second contribution is about testing the document, this can be read
  well later, after the application-specific instructions, been read. The third article is technical
  and not important at the beginning.

## InDesign specific tutorials

Those who create documents from Adobe’s desktop publishing program InDesign will find appropriate instructions here.

- [Defining logical reading order in InDesign](/en/basics/indesign/defining-logical-reading-order-in-indesign)
- [Add an alt text in InDesign](/en/basics/indesign/add-an-alt-text-in-indesign)
- [Defining artifacts in InDesign](/en/basics/indesign/defining-artifacts-in-indesign)
- [MadeToTag - Optimizations in seven steps](/en/basics/indesign/mtt-optimizations-in-seven-steps)

## Word specific tutorials

Those who create documents from Microsoft’s Word text processing program will find appropriate instructions here.

- [Defining PDF tags in Word](/en/basics/word/defining-pdf-tags-in-word)
- [Add an alt text in Word](/en/basics/word/add-an-alt-text-in-word)
- [Defining artifacts in Word](/en/basics/word/defining-artifacts-in-word)

## Acrobat specific tutorials

The better the document was created in InDesign or Word, the less work is required for post-processing in Acrobat Pro.

There is also the option to consider accessibility only after converting to a PDF. However, this is not recommended whenever possible.
