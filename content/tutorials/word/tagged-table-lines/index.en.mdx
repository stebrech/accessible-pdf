When exporting a table from Word 2013, the lines of a table are set within `<Span>` tags. `<Span>` tags are not allowed inside a `<TR>` (table row) on the same level as the `<TD>` tags (table cell). In addition, table lines must be marked as artifacts and must not be tagged.

## Issue detected in PDFs made from:

- Microsoft Word 2013 for Windows

## Manual approach in Acrobat

1. The path element must be marked as Artifact. Right-click on the path element inside the navigation pane “Tags” and choose “Change Tag to Artifact…”.
2. Delete the empty `<Span>` tag afterwards.
