## Manual approach in Acrobat

1. Copy the alternate text of the affected image (navigation pane “Tags” → right click on the `<Figure>` → Properties → Tag)
2. Delete the `<Figure>` tag
3. Create a new `<Figure>` tag with the “Reading Order” tool
4. Check the position of the new `<Figure>` tag in the tag tree (reading order)
5. Paste the alternate text you copied in step 1 within the new `<Figure>` tag (navigation pane “Tags” → right click on the `<Figure>` tag → Properties → Tag)
