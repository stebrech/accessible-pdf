## Manual approach in Acrobat

The fastest and easiest way is to change the `<Figure>` tag to an inline element.

To do so,

- move the `<Figure>` tag within the associated paragraph (`<P>` tag), or
- create a new `<P>` tag and move the `<Figure>` tag inside it.

Please check if the reading order (order of the tags) is still correct afterwards.

## Manual approach in Acrobat

Add the “Placement” attribute to the `<Figure>` tag and force it to be a block element.

1. Push the button “Edit attribute objects... ” in the properties of the `<Figure>` tag.
2. Click on the icon on the left of “Attribute objects”.
3. Select the appearing “Attribute object 1” and click the button “New item”.
4. Fill in the dialog box as follows:
   - Key: Placement
   - Value: Block
   - Value type: Name
