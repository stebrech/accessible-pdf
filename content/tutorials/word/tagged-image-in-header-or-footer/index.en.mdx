Since this issue only exists with the layout option “Behind Text” you might change this option if possible.

## Manual approach in Acrobat

1. The “Reading Order” tool can be used to select such an image
2. The button “Background/Artifact” changes the image to an Artifact
3. Repeat this step for each header or footer image
