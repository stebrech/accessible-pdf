## Manual approach in Word

For the directory entries Word uses the paragraph styles

- TOC 1
- TOC 2
- …

Within the paragraph settings of each paragraph style you can define the outline level. If the styles above have not “Body Text” defined for the outline level, the heading tags are going to be applied. So, you need to change them to the “Body Text” option.
