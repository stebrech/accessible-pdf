Decorative and unimportant information must be marked as artifact so that it can be ignored by [assistive technology (AT)](/glossary/#assistive-technology). The most efficient way is to determine artefacts already in InDesign and include them in the PDF export.

## Page-related artifacts in InDesign

Page numbers, running titles, etc. are automatically marked as artifacts by InDesign during export if they have been placed on a master page.

This also means that relevant content must not appear on a master page. For example, if the title only exists on a master page, it won’t be output.

Alternatively, texts can also be marked as artifacts using a paragraph style set up for this purpose. To do this, select “Artifact” in “Export Tagging” in the paragraph style options, see also [“Defining PDF tags in InDesign”](/basics/indesign/defining-pdf-tags-in-indesign/).

## Decorative artifacts in InDesign

Decorative objects can be marked as artifacts by clicking “Object” → “Object Export Options“. In the window, switch to the tab “Tagged PDF” and select “Apply Tag: Artefact”.

<NoteMessage>
  Any graphical shapes and strokes <strong>that do not contain alternative text</strong> are
  automatically marked as artifacts. For such elements, it is therefore not necessary to use the
  object export options.

### Decorative artifacts using the MadeToTag plugin

If you have the InDesign plugin [MadeToTag](https://www.axaio.com/doku.php/en:products:madetotag), you can save yourself the trouble of using the object export options. All objects that are outside an article are automatically marked as artifacts.
